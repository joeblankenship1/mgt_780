# MGT 780

This is a collection of exercises from University of Kentucky course MGT 780 derived from the materials for Analyzing Social Networks by Borgatti, Everett, and Johnson.

### Setup

Clone this repo or download the `.zip` file. Once you are inside the cloned/expanded `mgt_780` directory, you should create a virtual environment for the project:

```
python3 -m venv --copies .env
```

Followed by:

```
source .env/bin/activate
```

This should activate your virtual environment. You will have to activate your environment each time you want to use the notebooks.

Check your version of Python3:

```
python -V
```

Once the environment is active with Python3.6+, install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now you should be ready to go!

### Getting Started

Once you are in your virtual environment running python3 with all needed requirements:

```
jupyter lab
```

This will open up jupyter lab code editor for experimentation with the notebooks content. Double click on the notebook or your choice to begin a lesson.
