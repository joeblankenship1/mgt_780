It is true that researchers interested in corporate strategy tend not to be interested in careers. But we need to be careful: by chance along the overlap between the divisions is likely to be small since one of the divisions is very small (just 130 members). We should correct for the sizes of the different divisions. To do that we rerun Data|Affiliations, but this time choose Bonacich (1972) as the method. This effectively compares the observed overlaps with what you would get by chance, given the different division sizes, and assuming the choice of one division is independent of the choice of another. The results are normalized to run between 0 and 1. Before running it,  make sure to change the output file name to “normcomemb”. Your result should look like the below. Now, all of the numbers are comparable to each as the influence of group size has been filtered out.\n",
